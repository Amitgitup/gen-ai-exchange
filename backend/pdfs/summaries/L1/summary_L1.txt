The Jharkhand Export Policy 2023 aims to increase Jharkhand's share of Indian exports to 5% by 2028.  This will be achieved by improving infrastructure (high-speed internet, efficient transport), providing marketing assistance and R&D support, and establishing a World Trade Centre in Ranchi and export parks.  The policy focuses on supporting existing and potential exporting industries, particularly MSMEs, through incentives, training, and improved institutional mechanisms (State and District Export Promotion Committees).  Incentives include interest subsidies, electricity duty exemptions, land allotment, transport subsidies, and Export Development Assistance for MSMEs.  The policy also emphasizes quality management, skill development, and facilitating business through an exporter's card and export awards.  The policy is effective for five years.
